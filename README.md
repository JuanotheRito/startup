You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever sat down for a game of Catan with a friend who takes way too long to take their turn? Or gotten so engrossed in a conversation that the entire table forgets whose turn it is? The BGTimer Application allows you to not only set a time limit for those who think just a _little_ too long but also allows you to keep track of whose turn it is. It can also prompt those who might not be paying attention to take their turns! With this app, board game nights can progress without a cinch!
